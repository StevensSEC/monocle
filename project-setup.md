# Project Setup

1. Ensure that you have the following programs installed:

- git
- python3
- npm

You can check that these programs are installed by running `<program name> --version`. 

2. Run:

```
npm install -g expo-cli
```

This will install the Expo command line utility. Expo is a tool that will help us to test the project.

3. Install the Expo app on your Android or iOS device.
